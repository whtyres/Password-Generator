#  password-generator

I was required to create a password generator using Javascript in which the user would be able to enter the length of it (8-128 characters). After entering the lenghth of the password, I made a series of yes or no questions to confirm what the password would include like numbers, letter (uppercase or lower), and special characters. Upon entering the criteria, a password will generate.
